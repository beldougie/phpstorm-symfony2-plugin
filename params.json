{"name":"Phpstorm-symfony2-plugin","body":"# PHPStorm Symfony2 Plugins\r\n\r\n## Synopsis\r\nThis is my personal playground for building Symfony2 plugins for PHPStorm. PHPStorm is an awesome piece of software, crafted by the guys and gals at [Jetbrains](http://www.jetbrains.com). \r\n\r\nAt the moment none of the plugins in this repo does work as expected, but this is OK, as long as you do not rely on it.\r\n\r\n## What is already done?\r\nThe \"Clickable Views\" plugin works quite well at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Plans\r\nI have great respect for the work of Robert Gr√ºndler, who is working on a bunch of eclipse plugins here on [github using his account pulse00](https://github.com/pulse00/Symfony-2-Eclipse-Plugin). His work may inspire me to create a few implementations in PHPStorm.\r\n\r\nUnfortunatly, tha IntellJ API and plugins documentations are way behind the eclipse ecosystem's documentation - which will make it slower anyway.\r\n\r\nThe next plugin is \"Clickable Routes\".","tagline":"A plugin for PHPStorm that gives you an overview over your dic services.","google":"UA-32442100-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
